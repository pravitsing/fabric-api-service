# Fabric API Service

This project was modified from the following [codebase](https://github.com/olegabu/fabric-starter-rest). Thanks to the open source communities.

Here are some modifications:
- Enabling a private data collection feature
- Supporting an attribute-based user registration and enrollment
- Simplifying an error by returning a meaningful error message from a chaincode to a client
- Simplifying mapping function calls by introducing a chaincode function connection profile template
- Optimizing the project's invoke function to reduce transaction call latency between an off-chain API server and an on-chain chaincode
- Bug fixes
- etc.
